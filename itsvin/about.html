        <h1>About The Site</h1>
        <p>This website was designed, developed, and deployed by myself, Vincent Regimbal.
          While this website may not receive any awards for its design, it is is important
          to remember that this website is a display of complete compentency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website could have looked nicer through the use of an established Framework.  The website
          could have been finished faster if I used a Content Management System (CMS).  The website could
          have gone live quicker by using a Web Hosting Provider to take care of all the back-end work.
        </p>
        <p>
          By choosing to write the <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> myself and not using an established Framework,
          or a What You See Is What You Get (<em>WYSIWYG</em>) editor I proved that I know the languages that make up
          the world wide web.  By not using a Web Hosting Provider, I was able to demonstrate the knowledge
          needed to get a website on the internet.
